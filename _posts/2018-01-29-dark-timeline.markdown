summary: "A timeline showing when all the missing people are at the end of season 1 of Dark (spoilers)"

I just finished watching Dark on netflix. I love time travel stories.

I attempted to draw a timeline of what happened in season 1, focusing on the 4 kids that went missing (Mads, Erik, Mikkel and Yasin).

Here's what I came up with:
[![Timeline](/assets/dark-timeline.png)](/assets/dark-timeline.png)

[The dark wiki](http://dark-netflix.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Wiki) is the source for all the dates. I didn't bother labelling the lines properly, but it should be clear from the pictures/events.

I drew this in inkscape, which I'm unfamiliar with, so thats why it's quite messy. I wasn't sure how to make curved lines look good and also go where they're supposed to go. But inkscape seems useful to know.

I left out 1986 Helge, 2019 Claudia, Noah, and older Jonas, because it was hard to follow what was going on with them, and we don't know much about their motives yet.

It's also missing Gretchen (the dog), and the information that travels in time (like Michael's note, the time machine blueprints, the book). That might make an interesting timeline as well, but I wanted to keep this one as simple as possible.
